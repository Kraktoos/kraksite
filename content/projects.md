Here are some of the projects I've worked on over the years:

- [Train your Computing](https://tyc.kraktoos.com) (2022)

  - A website to practice you aim, clicking speed, typing speed and more, made with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

- [Python Elo System](https://github.com/Kraktoos/Python-Elo-System) (2021)
  - Yet another Python Implementation of the Elo rating system (how innovative am I right?).
